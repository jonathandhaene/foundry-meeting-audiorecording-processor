  "tooltips": {
    "audioFile": "Choose an audio file from your computer (MP3, WAV, M4A, etc.). This is the recording you want to convert to text.",
    "method": "Pick how your audio gets converted to text. Azure AI Speech is best for multi-speaker meetings. Azure Whisper is great for general-purpose transcription.",
    "languageCandidates": "If your meeting has people speaking multiple languages, list the possible language codes here (e.g. en-US,nl-NL). The system will detect which language is being spoken in each part.",
    "profanityFilter": "Choose how swear words are handled: Masked replaces them with ****, Removed deletes them entirely, Raw keeps them as-is.",
    "maxSpeakers": "Set the maximum number of distinct speakers you expect in the recording. A higher number won't hurt accuracy but helps the system prepare for larger meetings.",
    "wordLevelTimestamps": "When enabled, each individual word gets its own timestamp — useful if you need precise timing for captions or subtitles.",
    "temperature": "Controls randomness in the transcription. Keep it at 0 for the most accurate results. Higher values may produce varied but less reliable output.",
    "initialPrompt": "Give the AI context about your audio — names of people, technical terms, or the topic being discussed. This helps it transcribe unfamiliar words correctly.",
    "language": "Specify the language spoken in the recording (e.g. en-US for American English). Leave empty to let the system detect it automatically.",
    "customTerms": "List specialised words, acronyms, or names that the AI might not recognise — like product names, project codes, or technical jargon. One per line or comma-separated.",
    "termsFile": "Instead of typing custom terms one by one, upload a text file (.txt or .csv) containing your vocabulary list — one term per line.",
    "enableDiarization": "Speaker diarization figures out \"who said what\" in your recording. It labels each part of the conversation with a speaker name. Essential for meetings with multiple participants.",
    "enableNlp": "Turns on smart text analysis after transcription. This extracts a summary, key phrases, sentiment (positive/negative tone), named entities, and action items from your meeting.",
    "summaryLength": "Controls how long the auto-generated summary will be. A higher number of sentences means a more detailed summary; lower means a brief overview.",
    "nlpSegmentSentiment": "Analyses the emotional tone of each individual speech segment, so you can see how sentiment changed throughout the meeting.",
    "sentimentThreshold": "Minimum confidence score required to label a segment as positive or negative. Segments below this threshold are marked as neutral. Higher values mean only strong sentiments are shown; lower values make detection more sensitive.",
    "nlpKeyPhrases": "Automatically extracts the most important words and phrases from the transcription — great for a quick overview of what was discussed.",
    "nlpEntities": "Finds and labels people, organisations, locations, dates, and other named things mentioned in the meeting.",
    "nlpActionItems": "Detects commitments and to-dos mentioned during the meeting, like \"John will send the report by Friday\".",
    "nlpSummary": "Generates a concise summary of the entire meeting, capturing the main points discussed.",
    "audioChannels": "Number of audio channels. Use 1 (mono) for best speech recognition results. Use 2 (stereo) only if your recording has separate speaker channels.",
    "audioSampleRate": "Audio sample rate in Hz. 16 kHz is optimal for speech recognition. Higher rates preserve more audio detail but increase processing time and file size.",
    "audioBitRate": "Audio encoding bit rate. Lower values reduce file size, higher values preserve quality. 16k is sufficient for speech; use higher for music or high-fidelity recordings.",
    "hfModel": "HuggingFace model identifier. Use a pre-trained or fine-tuned Wav2Vec 2.0 model.",
    "hfUseApi": "Send audio to a remote HuggingFace Inference API or a Foundry-deployed endpoint instead of running locally.",
